# CSC335-Greatest-Common-Denominator
Assignment number one for CSC 335 Computer Algorithms. Two algorithms to find the greatest common denominator of two integers.

Algorithm #1 is the Consecutive Integer Checking Algorithm. Algorithm #2 is Euclid's Algorithm. This program outputs the most number of iterations, the least number of iterations, and the average number of iterations for 100 tests for both algorithms.
